Project coding guidelines

When working on a feature:
1. Create a feature branch in the GetElastech fork repo https://github.com/GetElastech
2. Do smaller bite-sized PRs into that dev branch. These can be reviewed by Elastech team + DL team members as needed, and merged into the feature branch.
3. Rebase this branch regularly on top of the upstream master, add commits for any conflicts
4. Submit large PR upstream to onflow/flow-go repo, and we will do code review of final branch
5. The size of each feature is less important. What we’re interested in is making sure that what’s merged into master on onflow/flow-go is complete and usable by the flow community. (edited) 
6. We use codesubmit@getelastech.com to work within the GetElastech fork, and use this account to create the PR against onflow/flow-go
